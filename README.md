# ScoreKeeper
An app to help users keep track of scores for card games
Consists of four screens
1. Welcome screen - simple title screen with link to next screen
2. New Game Screen - allows users to input the names of the players for the card game - also the option to specify a point cap
3. Game Screen - allows users to click on buttons corresponding to those names to keep score for card games
4. Win screen - comes up when someone hits the point cap, or when end game is pressed. It will display the name of the user that won
5. Score screen - Linked to the win screen - gives an ordered list of the names based off their scores. 

Currently still in the beginning phases with very little functionality.
